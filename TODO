- We cannot add objects after the Scope has been constructed. Changing the DOM of the scope doesn't change it on the javascript side of course. To add objects on the js side, we would need to add them manually through a js""" call.

- It would be convenient to have a locking mechanism for the x and y axes respectively. This is a quite common UI/graphics construct. It shouldn't be too hard to implement, the easiest approach seems to be adding a property to the object and having the setp function respect that.

- Only circles and rectangles work right now. It's trivial to add more objects as needed, but a general solution would be preferable.

- Dragging should work on touch devices. Right now, only clicking works which makes it less interactive. Simply setting events["touchstart"] = events["mousedown"] etc doesn't work since they override the browser defaults (zooming, moving) which makes for a bad user experience. Something other than event.page must be used, too.

- It should work in Blink, but it doesn't. The event.page variables seem to be undefined in electron(?)
